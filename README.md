DOSN-Architecture
=================

This is an architecture that will serve as a core for Distributed Online Social Networks. This architecture is directly related to the research and designs I have completed during my M.Tech. research project. 

Routing Protocol & DHT
----------------------
The architecture is based on the Kademlia routing protocol and DHT. The implementation of Kademlia used can be found here: https://github.com/JoshuaKissoon/Kademlia
